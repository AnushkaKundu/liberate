### Liberate
As the name stands, Liberate is a mobile application that frees you from your distractions and helps you focus on tasks that matter. 

1. Screen Time functionality: Liberate shows how much time you spend on each application. On a daily, weekly, biweekly and monthly basis. In form of pie-charts and bar-graphs.
2. Set time limits: Liberate allows you to set limits on your app usages, by putting a reminder after every 30 minutes that occoupies the entire screen to remind you to consider to choose to free yourself from the distraction. It notifies you when you cross your daily limit.
3. It allows you to set a mentor (a friend) whom you can give authority to allow access to apps once you have crossed you limit for the app. This will help you reach your screen time goals.
